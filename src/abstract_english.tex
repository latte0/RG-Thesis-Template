In recent years, activation functions such as sigmoidal and ReLU functions have been commonly used in deep learning.
Those activation functions can achieve high accuracy under certain conditions, but whether or not they are optimal in all situations is less discussed.
On the other hand, in the field of statistics, when the link function is unknown, a non-parametric estimation method using kernel functions has been estimated.
Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning activation function that does not specify the form of the function in advance.
Furthermore, we show that it is possible to predict a deep learning activation function on an actual dataset with the same or better accuracy than conventional activation functions.
